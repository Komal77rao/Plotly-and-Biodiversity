# Belly Button Biodiversity

# Overview of Project
In this project I created a dashboard for a client that has a complete panel of demographic information along with charts of the bacterial data for every volunteer. These volunteers will be able to identify whether the identified Improbable Beef species is found in their navel.


### Tools Used

Visual Studio Code


## Results

- When the user clicks on the Test Object ID number, web page provides the demographic information in the panel along with a Bar chart, Bubble chart and a Gauge chart for better visualization of the data.

- For example, if the volunteer's ID is 940, the volunteer will be provided with the following webpage. 

- The bar chart represents the Top 10 Bacteria cultures found in the belly button of the volunteer. 

- The gauge charts describes the number of times the belly button is scrubbed per week by the volunteer

- The volunteer can also see a bubble chart upon scrolling down on the webpage, which provides information about the bacetiera cultures per sample. 

- upon hovering over the bubble the volunteer can see the name of the bacteria species. 

- The image of the bubble chart can be found below.

- In order to remove the all the filters and add new search criteria, the user can refresh the page.
